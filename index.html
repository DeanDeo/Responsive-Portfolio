          Full Stack Web Developer with a background in a heavy client facing
          role, looking to leverage transferable skills from past experience
          such as working with a large team, analytical skills, communication,

          Previously in the mortgage business, I worked on a top producing
          branch in the country assisting in the production of ~$750 million in
          annual residential loan volume. Interacting with many consumers using
          our online web page along with sorting through a large database of
          past clients in search of refinance opportunities sparked my interest
          in Web Development and Big Data. I am looking forward to earning my
          certificate in Web Development and Coding from Northwestern University
          and entering the workforce excited about a new career.
