      <p>Full Stack Web Developer with a background in the mortgage business, looking to leverage transferable skills from past experience such as time management, working under pressure, organization, communication, and working as a team player for a position in Web Development/Data Analytics. Previously in the mortgage business, I worked on a top producing branch in the country assisting in the production of ~$750 million in annual residential loan volume. Interacting with many consumers using our online web page along with sorting through a large database of past clients in search of refinance opportunities sparked my interest in Web Development and Big Data. I am looking forward to earning my certificate in Web Development and Coding from Northwestern University and entering the workforce excited about a new career.</p>
      <p>Skills: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, MySQL</p>
